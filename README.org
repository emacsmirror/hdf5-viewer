* Emacs HDF5 Viewer Mode

This package facilitates
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format][HDF5]] file navigation
with a =dired=-like interface.

Advice (=hdf5-mode-maybe-startup=) is provided to =find-file= so that HDF5
files, which can be very large, are not read into any buffer; rather, the
python functions provided access only the parts of the file that are of interest
to the user.
