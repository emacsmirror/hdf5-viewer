* Emacs HDF5 Viewer Mode

This package facilitates [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format][HDF5]] file navigation with a =dired=-like interface.

In order to use the mode, you must first enable the global minor mode
=hdf5-viewer-find-file-mode=, which enables (or disables) the advising function
=hdf5-viewer-bypass-find-file=.  The =...bypass...= function associates an
=hdf5-viewer-mode= buffer associated with the HDF5 file.  This serves the dual
purpose of speeding up access into very large files and protecting the data from
accidental corruption.
